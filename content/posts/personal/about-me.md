# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Thiago! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate **Data Scientist** with over 6 years of experience in data analytics, machine learning, and statistical modeling. I specialize in building robust machine learning pipelines, automating processes, and delivering actionable insights that drive business decisions. My journey began with a strong foundation in **Statistics**, which Iâ€™m further enhancing through my ongoing **Masterâ€™s degree** at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, focusing on **Latent Trait Models**.

## My Expertise

I thrive at the intersection of **data and technology**, bringing ideas to life through tools like **Python**, **R**, and advanced statistical methods. My skill set includes:

- **Machine Learning & AI**: Scoring models, recommendation systems, NLP, and clustering.
- **Data Analytics**: Visualization, ETL processes, hypothesis testing, and A/B testing.
- **Deployment**: APIs with FastAPI, Flask, and serverless architectures using **AWS Lambda**.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and observability stacks.

Iâ€™m also building out my observability repository, leveraging the **Elastic Stack** to monitor machine learning API environments.

## My Current Projects

Currently, I am developing a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) platform at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, using R and Django. The project aims to create an API to implement Item Response Theory (IRT) models and Cumulative Distribution Models (CDM). I have already implemented unidimensional IRT models and established a database for item storage, which will enable adaptive and customized testing, providing a more efficient experience for assessing and measuring skills.

In my extra time, Iâ€™m exploring **machine learning model deployment** at scale. This includes:

- **Building pipelines**: Using FastAPI, NGINX, and Docker for efficient model hosting.
- **Improving Observability**: Integrating Metricbeat, Filebeat, and Elasticsearch for API monitoring.
- **Learning Serverless Tech**: Experimenting with AWS Lambda for flexible, scalable deployments.

## Outside of Work


Iâ€™m a football fan and find joy in both my professional and personal growth. I recently moved to Ireland, where I balance life as a student and a tech enthusiast. When Iâ€™m not immersed in data science models, I enjoy exploring the development side by learning about technologies related to AI and play video-games.

## Letâ€™s Connect!

Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate or chat about data science, new tech trends, or even soccer (shoutout to **Clube do Remo** fans!). Check out my portfolio on [GitHub](https://github.com/thiagofmiranda) or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiiagofmiranda).
